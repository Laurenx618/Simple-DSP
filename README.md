## Generating and Running the Module
To test, simply run `make test_fir`, then `make waves_fir`. The output in GTKwave should be a smoothed function over time.

The main python script that generates the verilog module is `filter.py`. Run this script, and it will generate three figures. One shows the taps that were generated by sci-py and written into the verilog module; one figure shows the frequency domain response of the filter; and the last one shows the unfiltered and filtered signals overlayed on a plot. The filtered output curve should match the curve obtained by the FIR module in GTKwave.
